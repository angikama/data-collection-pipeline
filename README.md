# Data Collection Pipeline

I have selected the TV Show section of the Rotten Tomatoes website because I enjoy watching TV series in my spare time. I do prefer to watch ones that are positively reviewed by others, and I would like a way to search shows from subscriptions I have.

The scraper selects 10 tv shows that have been filtered by high Tomatometer score, and avaiability on 3 streaming sites: Netflix, Disney + and Amazon Prime.

The Selenium webdriver allows automation of the Google Chrome browser, the methods within the class open up the browser window and naviagte to the website. They then select the desired filters to retrn a list of tv shows.
